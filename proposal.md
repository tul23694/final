# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Climate Care
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This is a website that specializes in providing resouces for climate change and activism. There will be a simulation that will show the effects of climate change in a x amount of years based on the user's input. underneath there will be more information and other resources for ways that the user can help combat the issue.  

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

We will have a simulation at the top that will be made from the data collected through a csv file. It will help us create a simultaion that will show the effects of claimte chnage on a global scale between 10 and 100 years from now. We will have inputs and push buttons that link you to different resources based on the button pushed. Some of the features of the push buttons include a voluteering opputrunies, donation sorces, and a quick fact sheet. We will be doing so through using python and creating a website. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

NONE

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We want to try to make the push buttons work effeicently. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We want to try to make the push buttons work effeicently as well as mkae the simulation up and going. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We want the simulation to work with an input, and cater the buttons to a person's specific location. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
Our first step is to learn how to make a website, and to see if Wix can work with python. We will put deadlines on when certain things for the project are due. So since we have to learn how to make a website, we will give ourselves a few days to reseach and watch videos, then come together to discuss what we have. The, we will start gathering the data on climate change that we will be using. Since there is two of us one, will gather the data and the other will find resources on how to implement it in our project. As for the buttons we will divide it amongst us. However, the simulation will be worked on together so that it can be as efficent as possible.
